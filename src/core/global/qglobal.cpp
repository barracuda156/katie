*/

/*!
    \class QFlags
    \brief The QFlags class provides a type-safe way of storing
    OR-combinations of enum values.


    \ingroup tools

    The QFlags<Enum> class is a template class, where Enum is an enum
    type. QFlags is used throughout Qt for storing combinations of
    enum values.

    The traditional C++ approach for storing OR-combinations of enum
    values is to use an \c int or \c uint variable. The inconvenience
    with this approach is that there's no type checking at all; any
    enum value can be OR'd with any other enum value and passed on to
    a function that takes an \c int or \c uint.

    Qt uses QFlags to provide type safety. For example, the
    Qt::Alignment type is simply a typedef for
    QFlags<Qt::AlignmentFlag>. QLabel::setAlignment() takes a
    Qt::Alignment parameter, which means that any combination of
    Qt::AlignmentFlag values,or 0, is legal:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 0

    If you try to pass a value from another enum or just a plain
    integer other than 0, the compiler will report an error. If you
    need to cast integer values to flags in a untyped fashion, you can
    use the explicit QFlags constructor as cast operator.

    If you want to use QFlags for your own enum types, use
    the Q_DECLARE_FLAGS() and Q_DECLARE_OPERATORS_FOR_FLAGS().

    Example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 1

    You can then use the \c MyClass::Options type to store
    combinations of \c MyClass::Option values.

    \section1 Flags and the Meta-Object System

    The Q_DECLARE_FLAGS() macro does not expose the flags to the meta-object
    system, so they cannot be used by Qt Script or edited in Qt Designer.
    To make the flags available for these purposes, the Q_FLAGS() macro must
    be used:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp meta-object flags

    \section1 Naming Convention

    A sensible naming convention for enum types and associated QFlags
    types is to give a singular name to the enum type (e.g., \c
    Option) and a plural name to the QFlags type (e.g., \c Options).
    When a singular name is desired for the QFlags type (e.g., \c
    Alignment), you can use \c Flag as the suffix for the enum type
    (e.g., \c AlignmentFlag).

*/

/*!
    \fn QFlags::QFlags(QFlag value)

    Constructs a QFlags object initialized with the given integer \a
    value.

    The QFlag type is a helper type. By using it here instead of \c
    int, we effectively ensure that arbitrary enum values cannot be
    cast to a QFlags, whereas untyped enum values (i.e., \c int
    values) can.

  \macro Q_DISABLE_COPY(Class)
  \relates QObject

  Disables the use of copy constructors and assignment operators
  for the given \a Class.

  Instances of subclasses of QObject should not be thought of as
  values that can be copied or assigned, but as unique identities.
  This means that when you create your own subclass of QObject
  (director or indirect), you should \e not give it a copy constructor
  or an assignment operator.  However, it may not enough to simply
  omit them from your class, because, if you mistakenly write some code
  that requires a copy constructor or an assignment operator (it's easy
  to do), your compiler will thoughtfully create it for you. You must
  do more.

  The curious user will have seen that the Qt classes derived
  from QObject typically include this macro in a private section:

  \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 43

  It declares a copy constructor and an assignment operator in the
  private section, so that if you use them by mistake, the compiler
  will report an error.

  \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 44

  But even this might not catch absolutely every case. You might be
  tempted to do something like this:

  \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 45

  First of all, don't do that. Most compilers will generate code that
  uses the copy constructor, so the privacy violation error will be
  reported, but your C++ compiler is not required to generate code for
  this statement in a specific way. It could generate code using
  \e{neither} the copy constructor \e{nor} the assignment operator we
  made private. In that case, no error would be reported, but your
  application would probably crash when you called a member function
  of \c{w}.

    \headerfile <QtGlobal>
    \title Global Qt Declarations
    \ingroup funclists

    \brief The <QtGlobal> header file includes the fundamental global
    declarations. It is included by most other Qt header files.

    The global declarations include \l{types}, \l{functions} and
    \l{macros}.

    The type definitions are partly convenience definitions for basic
    types (some of which guarantee certain bit-sizes on all platforms
    supported by Qt), partly types related to Qt message handling. The
    functions are related to generating messages, Qt version handling
    and comparing and adjusting object values. And finally, some of
    the declared macros enable programmers to add compiler or platform
    specific code to their applications, while others are convenience
    macros for larger operations.

    \section1 Types

    The header file declares several type definitions that guarantee a
    specified bit-size on all platforms supported by Qt for various
    basic types, for example \l qint8 which is a signed char
    guaranteed to be 8-bit on all platforms supported by Qt. The
    header file also declares the \l qlonglong type definition for \c
    {long long int } (\c __int64 on Windows).

    Several convenience type definitions are declared: \l qreal for \c
    double, \l uchar for \c unsigned char, \l uint for \c unsigned
    int, \l ulong for \c unsigned long and \l ushort for \c unsigned
    short.

    Finally, the QtMsgType definition identifies the various messages
    that can be generated and sent to a Qt message handler;
    QtMsgHandler is a type definition for a pointer to a function with
    the signature \c {void myMsgHandler(QtMsgType, const char *)}.

    \section1 Functions

    The <QtGlobal> header file contains several functions comparing
    and adjusting an object's value. These functions take a template
    type as argument: You can retrieve the absolute value of an object
    using the qAbs() function, and you can bound a given object's
    value by given minimum and maximum values using the qBound()
    function. You can retrieve the minimum and maximum of two given
    objects using qMin() and qMax() respectively. All these functions
    return a corresponding template type; the template types can be
    replaced by any other type.

    Example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 3

    <QtGlobal> also contains functions that generate messages from the
    given string argument: qCritical(), qDebug(), qFatal() and
    qWarning(). These functions call the message handler with the
    given message.

    Example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_global_qglobal.cpp 4

    qInstallMsgHandler() function which installs the given
    QtMsgHandler, and the qVersion() function which returns the
    version number of Qt at run-time as a string.

    \section1 Macros

    The <QtGlobal> header file provides a range of macros (Q_CC_*)
    that are defined if the application is compiled using the
    specified platforms. For example, the Q_CC_GNU macro is defined
    if the application is compiled using GNU Compiler Collection.
    The header file also declares a range of macros (Q_OS_*) that
    are defined for the specified platforms. For example, Q_OS_WIN32
    which is defined for Microsoft Windows.

    The purpose of these macros is to enable programmers to add
    compiler or platform specific code to their application.

    The remaining macros are convenience macros for larger operations:
    The QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP() and QT_TR_NOOP() macros provide the
    possibility of marking text for dynamic translation,
    i.e. translation without changing the stored source text. The
    Q_ASSERT() and Q_ASSERT_X() enables warning messages of various
    level of refinement. The Q_FOREACH() and foreach() macros
    implement Qt's foreach loop.

    The Q_INT64_C() and Q_UINT64_C() macros wrap signed and unsigned
    64-bit integer literals in a platform-independent way. The
    Q_CHECK_PTR() macro prints a warning containing the source code's
    file name and line number, saying that the program ran out of
    memory, if the pointer is 0. The qPrintable() macro represent an
    easy way of printing text.

    Finally, the QT_POINTER_SIZE macro expands to the size of a
    pointer in bytes, and the QT_VERSION and QT_VERSION_STR macros
    expand to a numeric value or a string, respectively, specifying
    Qt's version number, i.e the version the application is compiled
    against.

    \fn QtMsgHandler qInstallMsgHandler(QtMsgHandler handler)
    \relates <QtGlobal>

    Installs a Qt message \a handler which has been defined
    previously. Returns a pointer to the previous message handler
    (which may be 0).

    The message handler is a function that prints out debug messages,
    warnings, critical and fatal error messages. The Qt library (debug
    mode) contains hundreds of warning messages that are printed
    when internal errors (usually invalid function arguments)
    occur. Qt built in release mode also contains such warnings unless
    QT_NO_WARNING_OUTPUT and/or QT_NO_DEBUG_OUTPUT have been set during
    compilation. If you implement your own message handler, you get total
    control of these messages.

    The default message handler prints the message to the standard
    output under X11 or to the debugger under Windows. If it is a
    fatal message, the application aborts immediately.

    Only one message handler can be defined, since this is usually
    done on an application-wide basis to control debug output.

    To restore the message handler, call \c qInstallMsgHandler(0).

    Example:

    If you pass the function a format string and a list of arguments,
